# Monorepo for "hello world" projects

These are projects I've done at least the first step for.

Depending on the framework, that might mean just running the bootstrapping CLI or going through the initial intro tutorial.


## Note

I don't claim to have more than cursory knowledge of these frameworks.

This monorepo exists for the sake of exploration. 

As I get more time, I'll dig more into each framework depending on how I like the languages or installation.

## Opinions

### NextJS (via create-next-app)
This framework makes it pretty easy to get started with a React-based frontend, which I appreciate.
If I were developing an application frontend and backend at the same time, I'd probably opt for NextJS.
I'm not crazy about the coupling between the front-end and back-end, but there are ways around it.
There is the ability to `export` the app to static HTML files, but in that case, it seems like create-react-app would be preferable.

### React (via create-react-app)
React is my favorite front-end framework so far. 
I've used server-side rendering before, as well as static generation.
When I start new front-end projects, I generally opt for React.

### Flask
Flask was the easiest to get started with. I could imagine using it to develop APIs.

### Django
I like Django's architecture a lot. 
It was easy to follow the setup, and I feel like I could use it to develop web applications relatively easily.
I'm excited to explore it more.

### Vue
I've only installed the CLI. Haven't looked into it much yet.

### Angular
I've only installed the CLI. Haven't looked into it much yet.

### Spring
Eh, I'm not big on Java yet. I'm sure this is a decent framework, but I wasn't wowed or interested immediately.
