# Monorepo for "hello world" projects

These are projects I've done at least the first step for.

Depending on the framework, that might mean just running the bootstrapping CLI or going through the initial intro tutorial.


## Note

I don't claim to have more than cursory knowledge of these frameworks.

This monorepo exists for the sake of exploration. 

As I get more time, I'll dig more into each framework depending on how I like the languages or installation.
